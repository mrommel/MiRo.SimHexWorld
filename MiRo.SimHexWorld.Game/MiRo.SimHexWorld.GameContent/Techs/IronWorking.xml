	<Description>Iron working is older than history itself. The first iron worked probably came from meteorites; when this useful material was not to be found, the ancient people probably looked elsewhere for similar materials. Iron "smelting" - the extraction of the metal from iron ore - appears to have been discovered in the 12th century BC, in the Caucuses Mountains, Asia Minor, or possibly India. The production of wrought iron dates from approximately 1,000 BC.</Description>
